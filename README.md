Resume App Initiative
Description
The Resume App Initiative is a comprehensive, self-directed project aimed at developing a full-stack web application with integrated machine learning capabilities. This initiative serves as a platform for me to demonstrate my skills and expertise in full-stack development, machine learning engineering, and cloud computing.
Phase 1: Setting up the Foundation (Completed)
In Phase 1, I set up a server from scratch, including:
Creating a virtual machine (VM) in Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Installing Ubuntu and configuring the operating system
Setting up Apache and configuring the web server
Configuring Django and creating the initial project structure
Setting up security measures to protect the server and application
Creating my first GitHub account and implementing version control
Launching the website and troubleshooting initial issues
Phase 2: Backend and Frontend Development (Upcoming)
In Phase 2, I will focus on coding the backend and frontend of the Resume App using:
Django for backend development
Advanced React methods for frontend development
Phase 3: Machine Learning Integration (Upcoming)
In Phase 3, I will leverage GCP's machine learning capabilities and TensorFlow to integrate machine learning models into the Resume App. This phase will involve:
Selecting and implementing machine learning projects of increasing complexity
Integrating machine learning models into the Resume App
Phase 4: IOS Application Deployment (Upcoming)
In Phase 4, I will deploy an IOS application that incorporates the machine learning models and capabilities developed in Phase 3. This phase will demonstrate my ability to deploy machine learning models in IOS applications.
Goals
The Resume App Initiative serves two primary goals:
Become a Full-Stack Engineer and ML Engineer: Develop expertise in full-stack development, machine learning engineering, and cloud computing.
Get a Job at Google or Meta: Demonstrate my skills and expertise to potential employers, with the ultimate goal of landing a job at Google or Meta.
Stay Tuned!
Follow along as I progress through the Resume App Initiative. I'll be sharing updates, insights, and lessons learned along the way.
