      <h1>Welcome to my personal website!</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a dedicated professional with a background in industrial controls engineering, currently on a transformative journey to expand my expertise in finance and technology. In 2024, I successfully balanced a full-time career while preparing for and writing both CFA Level 1 and 2 exams, accumulating hundreds of hours of study time. My interest in continuous learning also led me to explore the fascinating world of machine learning and cloud technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        For 2025, my focus is clear:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pass CFA Level 2 and continue toward CFA Level 3 certification.</li>
        <li>Become a certified Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Developer.</li>
        <li>Build a full-stack website showcasing my professional experience, including a blog where I'll deploy various ML applications inspired by my work as a controls engineer and personal observations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This platform will serve as both my digital portfolio and a space where I can share insights, explore data-driven solutions, and demonstrate my technical projects. With a passion for both structured finance and cloud technologies, I'm committed to continuous growth and leveraging my diverse skill set to solve complex problems.

        Thank you for visiting, and feel free to explore my projects and connect!
